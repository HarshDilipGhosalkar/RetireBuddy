Treatment costs for various diseases is usually higher in Northern cities of India as compared to Southern cities like Bengaluru and Chennai
Treatment costs are not uniform across India. For the same disease, it could vary vastly between different cities located in different parts of the country. For example, healthcare costs are usually higher in northern cities like Delhi and Kolkata when compared with South Indian cities like Bengaluru, Chennai, and Hyderabad.

This is the precise reason why millions of people in India choose to migrate from one city to another to save their medical expenses. In this article, we’ve tried to provide brief information about the treatment charges of few common diseases like cancer, kidney failure, cataract, etc. in commonly preferred Indian cities, namely New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad.

Cancer- There are numerous well-equipped cancer hospitals in various metropolitan cities of India. The two most common type of cancer treatments are as follows:
Lung Cancer Treatment which costs approximately ₹27000 to ₹42000 per cycle. In case it requires lung surgery, it can cost you roughly ₹3 to ₹3.7 lakhs. Chennai and Hyderabad will be the preferred cities for affordable treatment, while New Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru will on the higher side of the range.
Ovarian Cancer Treatment includes two phases. The first two stages of ovarian cancer are customarily treated with surgeries that can cost you approximately ₹3 to ₹4.5 lakhs. Whereas, treatment for the last two stages of ovarian cancer would cost ₹27K to ₹48K, depending upon the city and hospital.
Cardiovascular Diseases- - Nearly 25% deaths before the age of 70 in India occur due to cardiovascular diseases. On the flip side, India is considered as one of the best places in the world for cardiac surgery. The most common treatments for cardiovascular diseases include bypass surgeries, angioplasty, valve replacement, and open-heart surgeries. The rate of bypass surgery in different cities is tabulated below:

Abstract
Background:
Diabetes mellitus is a major noncommunicable disease. While mortality rates are increasing, the costs of managing the disease are also increasing. The all-India average monthly expenditure per person (pppm) is reported to be ₹ 1,098.25, which translates to an annual expenditure of ₹13,179 per person.

Purpose:
While a number of studies have gone into the aspect of the cost of disease management, we do not find any study which has pan-India reach. We also do not find studies that focus on differences (if any) between rural and urban areas, age or on the basis of gender. We planned to report the cost of illness (COI) in diabetes individuals as compared to others from the data of a pan-India trial.

Methods:
Government of India commissioned the Indian Yoga Association to study the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in India in 2017. As part of the questionnaire, the cost of treatment was also captured. Data collected from 25 states and union territories were analyzed using the analysis of covriance (ANCOVA) test on SPSS version 21.

Results:
There was a significant difference (P < .05) between the average expenses per person per month (pppm) of individuals with self-reported known diabetes (₹1,357.65 pppm) and others (unknown and/or nondiabetes individuals–₹ 999.91 pppm). Similarly, there was a significant difference between rural (₹2,893 pppm) and urban (₹4,162 pppm) participants and between those below (₹1,996 pppm) and above 40 years (₹5,059 pppm) of age.

Conclusion:
This preliminary report has shown that the COI because of diabetes is significantly higher than others pointing to an urgent need to promote disease-preventive measures.

Introduction
There are 463 million people living in the world with diabetes today. It is projected that by 2045, 700 million people will have the disease worldwide. In India, from an estimated 50 million people in 2010, the count is expected to increase to 134 million by 2045.1 Diabetes is responsible for a wide range of neurological manifestations. These can be the result of metabolic disorders or their treatment, or they can represent secondary manifestations.2

In the USA, the total estimated cost of diagnosed diabetes in 2017 is USD 327 billion including USD 237 billion in direct medical costs and USD 90 billion in reduced productivity.3 This represents a 26% increase between 2012 and 2017.3 People with diagnosed diabetes, on average, have medical expenses ∼2.3 times higher than what expenditure would be in the absence of diabetes.3 People with diagnosed diabetes incur average medical expenditure of USD 16,750 per year, of which USD 9,600 is attributed to diabetes.3

In India, the median average annual direct and indirect costs associated with diabetes care were estimated at ₹ 25,391 and ₹ 4,970, respectively.4 Extrapolating from the Indian population, the annual cost of diabetes was found be USD 31.9 billion in 2010.4

Over 400 papers have been published over the past 20 years.5 The cost of diabetes therapy increases linearly along with the duration of the disease.6 The average life-time cost of all drugs used in diabetes management is estimated at ₹ 19,45,135.6 The average total expenditure per patient per month (pppm) was ₹ 1,265, out of which medical expenditure was ₹ 993 and nonmedical expenditure was ₹ 271.6 The total COI for diabetic care without any complications was ₹ 22,456 per patient per annum and with complication was ₹ 30,634.7 There exists a high burden of missed clinic appointments among diabetes patients in tertiary care government health settings in India.8 This appears to be related to the high cost in terms of both time and money involved in attending appointments for the modest benefit of a dispensation of a 15-day drug refill.8 Nearly one-fourth of the income of the patient was spent for diabetic care.9 The total expenditure on diabetes is ₹ 912 per visit, the direct cost of health care for a diabetic individual was ₹ 553 and indirect expenditure was ₹ 359.10 The average time lost on each visit was 2.6 h and included travel time, waiting period, and consultation.10

While a number of studies have been conducted, to the best of our knowledge, there appears to be none which has an All-India sample. There appears to be no studies comparing costs between urban and rural areas. This article is an attempt to bridge the gap.

Methods
The Indian Yoga Association was commissioned in 2016 to 2017 by the Government of India to conduct this study which was undertaken in two phases (details of the methodology have also been published).11 In brief, phase 1 was to estimate the prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes across the country, and phase 2 was to conduct a randomized controlled trial using a validated yoga lifestyle protocol. A detailed questionnaire was used to collect data on various parameters from the subjects. One of the parameters was the COI which has also been used for analysis in this article. Data was anaylzed by using SPSS (23.0) version.12

Note: N is number of partcipants.

Out of the 7,055 participants from 50 districts of 25 states of India (over 200 villages and urban census enumeration blocks), 2014 reported that they had prior diagnosis of diabetes. The remaining 4,941 included those who marked “No” to the question “Have you ever been told by a health care provider that you have diabetes?” These were placed in the “others” category and included both those who were not aware that they had diabetes and those with no diabetes. Out of the 7,055 participants, 3,372 were males and 3,683 were females, and 4,162 were from urban and 2,893 from rural locations.

For the 7,055 participants, the average monthly health expenditure was calculated as ₹ 1,098.25, which translates to ₹ 13,179 per annum. Thus, about 17% of the expenditure of the household was spent on health care.

The average expenditure per month for males was found to be ₹ 1,120.59 (₹ 13,447.08/year), while for females it was ₹ 1,077.74 (₹ 12,932.88/year). The average amount spent in rural areas was ₹ 1,072.28 (₹ 12,867.36/year), while that in urban areas was ₹ 1,135.61 (₹ 13,627.32/year). For those below the age group of 40 years, the average monthly expense was ₹ 1,007.63 (₹ 12,091.56/year), while for those above the age of 40 years it was ₹ 1,132.90 (₹ 13,594.80/year).

Discussion
This pan-India study looking at self-reported COI for diabetes within one year from the data of a larger study planned for primary prevention of diabetes, covering 50 districts in 25 states/union territories, has shown that the average monthly health expenditure was ₹ 1,357.65 for diabetes and ₹ 999.91 in others. Similarly, the difference between the expenditure in rural and urban households and the age of the patient are also statistically significant. Those below the age of 40 spend significantly less than those who are above the age of 40.

Approximately 17% of the total household expenditure was on health care.

While average monthly expenditure is in line with other studies, we find that the health expenditure goes up significantly for those who are aware of their diagnosis. This is an area that has a potential for further research.

Limitation
Analyses of multiple surveys per country or territory show how the estimated share of the household expenditure devoted to health (i.e., health expenditure share) would have varied if survey instruments with different characteristics had been employed.13 The questions in our survey were many and exhaustive, and could have had an impact on the response. The survey was administered by yoga practitioners and there is a possibility that bias of the yoga practitioner could not have been excluded.

Conclusion
A 17% share of medical expenses is a very high number and reinforces the belief that the current governmental interventions and medical insurance are highly inadequate. At a national level, the percentage spent on health care as a percentage of GDP is roughly around 1% to 1.5% and the near-term target is to achieve 2.5% of the GDP. Also, there is a need to look at why there is a significant difference in expenditure after diagnosis.

The surgical cost of the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy ranges between Rs. 2,00,000 to Rs. 2,75,000. On the other hand, medicinal cost may vary between Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 5,000.

n most cases of Neurological conditions the main cost goes towards diagnosing the problem. For brain stroke patients who are rushed to a Neurology hospital the first step is to get an MRI Scan of the Brain done which costs Rs. 10000 - 12000 at different hospitals. Some blood tests alongwith the MRI scan are also done. If the MRI Scan reveals brain stroke then the cost of Thrombolyzing the patient would cost Rs. 75000 - 90000 if the stroke is ischemic in nature. The patient will have to be admitted to Neuro ICU for 3-4 days and the total hospitalization may be for 3-4 days. The total cost for the treatment of Ischemic Brain Stroke would cost Rs. 2 - 2.5 lacs. However if the stroke is haemorrhagic then the patient is managed conservatively in the ICU and then in the ward. Patients of Haemorrhagic stroke may stay in the hospital for 15-20 days. In such cases the cost of hospitalization would be in the range of 1.5 - 1.8 lacs. However the cost of physiotherapy post discharge would be in the range of 20-25 thousand per month and the rehabilitation may last 1-2 years. Brain stroke patients who come to India for rehabilitation spend close to USD 5000 for each month of hospitalization and physiotherapy. Typically such patients require 30-45 days of intensive rehab during which they recover 25-30 % in terms of mobility and functions.

A stroke can be caused by a blocked artery or by the bursting of a blood vessel in the brain. In 85% of strokes, it is the former (ischemic stroke). In acute cases, doctors say the clock starts ticking as soon as the patient suffers the first symptoms. But in a majority of cases, patients almost always arrive after the first few hours have elapsed.
KEM used to mainly provide the first step of treatment which is the Intravenous thrombolysis therapy (IVT)-a drug injected intravenously to dissolve the clot. But, a crucial limiting factor-it must be administered within 4.5 hours of the onset of stroke-meant most couldn't benefit from it. With the upgraded facility, the hospital will now also offer the advanced step of treatment called thrombectomy, a procedure to remove a blood clot from inside an artery or vein. A biplane digital subtraction angiography (DSA) machine worth Rs 8.5 crore, which was inaugurated by BMC commissioner Ajoy Mehta on Wednesday, will aid in carrying out the procedure. Currently, only private hospitals provide all these interventions, which can collectively cost Rs 10 lakh or more.
At KEM, which receives 6-8 stroke patients daily, head of neurology, Dr Sangeeta Ravat, said few patients reach in time to receive IVT. The delay is underlined by the fact that in the last two years, out of the 3,600-4,000 stroke patients who came to KEM, merely 54 qualified to receive the IVT. "Patients don't look at strokes as something like a heart attack that can kill. Besides the delay, there is also time lost in decision-making, like whether or not to opt for the IVT injection, which costs Rs 25,000-40,000," she said. Tiding these hiccups, she said at least six departments, including neurology, neurosurgery, anaesthesia, radiology, medicine and physiotherapy, will work together to bring down the hospital door-to-needle time to 30 minutes.
